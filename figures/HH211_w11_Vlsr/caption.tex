{Left:} Integrated intensity map of the NH$_3$(1,1) line. 
{Right:} Velocity field for HH-211 derived from fitting the NH$_3$(1,1) line.
Outflow orientation is shown by the arrows. 
Contours are shown starting at 5$-\sigma$ with steps of 
2$-\sigma$, where $\sigma=$1.9\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$\,\kms is the standard deviation measured 
around the emission free region.
Position of the protostar is shown by the star. 
Beam size and scale-bar are shown in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners, respectively.
