\subsection{Calculation of specific angular momentum radial profile}
The specific angular momentum is calculated as follow.
We know the position of the protostar or first core candidate (see Table\ref{table:obs}) and this 
defines the center of the system.
We measure the centroid velocity obtained from the NH3 fit at the YSO position.
