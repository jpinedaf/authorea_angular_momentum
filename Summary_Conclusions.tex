\section{Summary and Conclusions}
aa
\begin{itemize}
\item We determine the specific angular momentum radial profile for three YSOs and 
find that is consistent among these three sources:
\[ j(r) = 10^{-3.53\pm0.35}\left( \frac{r}{1,000 \textrm{au}}\right)^{1.70\pm 0.08}~\textrm{km s$^{-1}$ pc}\]
\item We determine expressions for the specific angular momentum of the entire core under 
a more general condition, $j \propto R_{rot}^q$, than solid body rotation.
\item The specific angular momentum radial profile is consistent with previous determinations 
based on dense cores velocity gradients, only after we correct for the non-solid body rotation 
nature of the cores.
\item If the specific angular momentum is conserved inwards of 1,000 au, then the 
largest disk towards these low-mass YSOs ($M_*\sim 0.05\,M_\odot$) is below 80\,au radius.
\end{itemize}
