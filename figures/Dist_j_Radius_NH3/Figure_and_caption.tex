Radial profile of the specific angular momentum ($j=r \times \delta v$) for the three sources studied: 
IRAS03282, HH211, and L1451-mm in blue, green, and yellow, respectively. 
Solid line shows the best-fit power-law relation to the data.
Dash curve shows the proposed specific angular momentum profile by \cite{Belloche_2013}.
