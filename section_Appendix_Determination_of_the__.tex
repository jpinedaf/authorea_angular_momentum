Determination of the Total angular momentum ($J$) and specific angular momentum ($J/M$) in the case of differential rotation and/or a radial density profile.

Here, we will assume that the density is spherically symmetric and that it can be described 
by a single power-law depending only on the distance to the central protostar:
\begin{equation}
\rho = \rho_0 r^{-p}~. \label{eq:density}
\end{equation}
Naturally, the total enclosed mass can be described as 
\begin{equation}
M(<R) = \frac{4\pi}{(3-p)} R^{3-p}~,
\end{equation}
for $p\ne 3$.

Also, we will assume that the specific angular momentum can be described in spherical coordinates as as
\begin{equation}
j(r,\theta) = j_0 ( r \cos \theta)^q~.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the total angular momentum within a radius $R$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
J(R) &=& \int_{Volume} j(r,\theta) \rho(r) d\Omega r^2 dr \\
&=& \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\int_0^R j_0 ( r \cos \theta)^q\, \rho_0 r^{-p}\, r^2 dr 
\end{eqnarray}
