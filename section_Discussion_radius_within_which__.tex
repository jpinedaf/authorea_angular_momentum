radius within which the specific angular momentum is conserved. 

\subsection{Interpretation of the power-law}
This power-law is mid-way between the relations for solid body rotation ($j\propto r^{2}$) and for turbulence ($j\propto r^{1.5}$). 
For solid body rotation, the velocity at distance $r$ is $v(r)=\Omega r$, 
where $\Omega$ is the angular speed, 
and therefore the specific angular momentum is $j_{SolidBody}=\Omega r^2$. 
In the case of a pure turbulent field that follows Larson's relation ($\delta v(r) \propto r^{0.5}$), 
then the velocity at distance $r$ is $v(r)\approx \delta v(r) \propto r^{0.5}$, 
and therefore the specific angular momentum is $j_{turb}\propto r^{1.5}$ \citep{Burkert_2000}. 

Therefore, this suggest that the dynamics of the dense core, even at scales of 1,000 au, are still 
heavily influenced by the turbulence of the parental molecular cloud.

\subsection{Are these results consistent with those of Dense cores?}
The previous study of dense cores by \cite{Goodman_1993} found that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{J}{M} = 10^{-0.7\pm0.2} \left(\frac{R}{\textrm 1 pc}\right)^{1.6\pm 0.2}~,
\end{equation}
where it assumed solid body rotation and uniform density. 
This relation predicts an specific angular momentum at 1,000 au of $3.95\times 10^{-5}$\,\kms pc, 
which is one order of magnitude lower than the directly measured values.

The main source of discrepancy is due to the assumption of solid body rotation.

\subsection{The effect on numerical simulations}
The initial conditions are much different!
