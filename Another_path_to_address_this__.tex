Another path to address this question is to determine the specific angular momentum radial profile from the dense core scales ($\sim$10,000 au) 
down to the scales relevant to disk properties ($\sim$50 au).

We present the results of determining the radial profile down to $\sim$1,000 au towards three young sources which are in a close to edge-on configuration (2 Class 0, HH211 and IRAS, and one First Hydrostatic Core candidate, L1451-mm), 
and discuss the relevance of the results for numerical simulations of disk formation.
