\section{Discussion}


radius within which the specific angular momentum is conserved. 

\subsection{Interpretation of the power-law}
This power-law is mid-way between the relations for solid body rotation ($j=r\times v=\Omega r^2$, where $\Omega$ is the angular speed of solid body rotation) and for turbulence ($j\propto r^{1.5}$)
  
 \subsection{The effect on numerical simulations}
 The initial conditions are much different!
