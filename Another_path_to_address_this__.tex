Another path to address this question is to determine the specific angular momentum radial profile from the dense core scales ($\sim 10,000$\,au) 
down to the scales relevant to disk properties ($\sim 50 $\,au).

In this paper, we present the results of determining the specific angular momentum radial profile from 
$\sim 10,000$\,au down to $\sim 1,000$\,au towards three young sources.
These sources are in a close to edge-on configuration (2 Class 0, HH211 and IRAS, and one First Hydrostatic Core candidate, L1451-mm).
We discuss the relevance of the results for numerical simulations of disk formation.
