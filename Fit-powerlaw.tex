The specific angular momentum profile of the different sources is consistent with being a single power-law.
The resulting minimum least-squared power-law fit to all three sources is
\begin{equation}
j(r) = 10^{-3.53\pm 0.35}\left( \frac{r}{1,000 \textrm{au}}\right)^{1.70\pm0.08} \textrm{km s$^{-1}$ pc}~.
\end{equation}

Notably, we do not find a break in the power-law down to 1,000 au, although there might be a hint 
for a flattening on the radial profiles of HH211 and L1541-mm. 
Higher resolution observations will be crucial to continue with the radial profile down to 
smaller radii where the specific angular momentum could be conserved.
