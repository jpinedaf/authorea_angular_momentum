\subsection{Specific angular momentum radial profile}
The specific angular momentum at a distance $r$, is defined as $j(r)=r \times V_{rel}$, 
where $V_{rel}$ is the relative velocity of the gas with respect to the center of mass. 
In the case of a protostellar core, the center of mass is well approximated by the position of 
the YSO. 
%
The specific angular momentum is calculated as follow.
We know the position of the protostar or first core candidate (see Table\ref{table:obs}) and this 
defines the center of the system.
We measure the centroid velocity obtained from the NH$_3$ fit at the YSO position.
