\label{Fig:summary}
Radial profile of the specific angular momentum ($j=R_{rot} V_{rot}$) for the three sources studied: 
IRAS03282, HH211, and L1451-mm in blue, green, and yellow, respectively. 
Solid line shows the best-fit power-law relation to the data.
Dash curve shows the previously proposed specific angular momentum profile \citep{Belloche_2013}.
