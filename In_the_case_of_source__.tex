In the case of source HH211 and L1451-mm the centroid velocity maps have an velocity gradient 
in a direction similar to the observed outflow. 
However, in the case of IRAS03282 the centroid velocity maps also displays a velocity gradient 
along the outflow direction \citep{Tobin_2011}, which creates a larger spread in the value of the 
specific angular momentum at any given rotation radius.
However, since the outflow effect appears to be present in the red and blue outflow components, then 
it is possible to derive the average rotational velocity, but with a larger uncertainty.
