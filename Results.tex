\section{Results}

\subsection{Line fit}
We fit the NH$_3$ (1,1) line with all the hyperfine components using the \verb+pyspeckit+ package \cite{2011ascl.soft09001G}. 
This implements the NH$_3$ hyperfine structure fit describe in \cite{Rosolowsky_2008} within \verb+python+.
This method minimizes the difference between the observed profile and a synthetic NH$_3$ line profile 
that is parametrized by the line centroid velocity ($V_{lsr}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$), 
kinetic temperature ($T_{kin}$), excitation temperature ($T_{ex}$), and column density ($N_{NH_3}$).

For these source we fit the NH$_3$ (1,1) line towards all positions with a peak brightness larger than
5 times the line-free rms. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:HH211}.
